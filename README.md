# Snoring-Sound-Recognition-and-Recording-App-Development
Creating a mobile app that can recognize and record snoring sounds, along with analyzing and tracking sleep patterns, is a great project that involves audio processing, mobile app development, and possibly artificial intelligence. Here's a step-by-step outline on how to approach building such an app.
Key Features for the App:

    Sound Recording and Snoring Detection:
        The app should be able to continuously listen for sounds while the user is asleep.
        Detect snoring sounds with a certain threshold of sound frequency, intensity, or patterns.

    Sound Analysis:
        Classify and analyze snoring using audio analysis techniques.
        Provide a detailed report (e.g., when snoring occurred, for how long, and its intensity).

    Recording Playback:
        Allow the user to play back the recordings of their snoring, enabling them to hear the intensity and frequency of the sound.

    Sleep Pattern Tracking:
        Track when the user is asleep and correlate snoring data with their sleep cycle.
        Optionally, integrate with wearable devices like a smart band or watch to get more detailed sleep data (e.g., heart rate, sleep stages).

    User-Friendly Interface:
        The app should have an easy-to-use interface for setting up the recording, reviewing snoring occurrences, and viewing sleep patterns.

    Notifications:
        Remind users to use the app before going to bed.
        Alert users if the app detects an unusual amount of snoring or if there are improvements.

Step-by-Step Guide to Develop the App:
1. Mobile Platform Selection

    Android: You can use Java or Kotlin to build the app for Android devices.
    iOS: You can use Swift to build the app for iPhones or Flutter/ React Native for cross-platform development.

2. Core Components for the App
A. Audio Recording and Snoring Detection:

    Sound Input: Use the device’s microphone to record audio in the background. The app should run continuously (or when activated) while the user is sleeping.
    Threshold Detection: Implement an algorithm that recognizes snoring based on sound intensity (amplitude) and frequency patterns. Snoring sounds have unique characteristics, such as low-frequency rumblings or specific rhythm patterns.

Libraries for Audio Recording:

    Android: Use the AudioRecord class in Android to capture microphone input.
    iOS: Use the AVAudioRecorder class for recording in iOS.

Libraries for Sound Analysis:

    Auditory Spectrum Analysis: Use libraries to analyze the recorded sound to detect snoring. You may consider:
        Librosa (Python) for sound analysis. It provides various signal processing tools like extracting frequency components, pitch detection, etc.
        SoundAnalyzer (Android) or iOS AudioKit can also be used for real-time audio signal processing.

AI for Snoring Detection:

    Use machine learning models to detect snoring patterns. You can build a simple model based on labeled data of snoring vs. non-snoring sounds.
    Pre-trained models or frameworks like TensorFlow Lite for on-device machine learning can be used.

B. Sound Analysis and Reporting:

    Real-time Analysis: Use FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) to analyze the audio in real time and detect snoring frequencies.
    Duration and Frequency: Track how long the snoring lasts and the intensity.
    Database: Use a local database (like SQLite or Firebase) to store the timestamps, intensity, and duration of snoring events.

C. Playback and History:

    Allow users to play back recordings and view detailed stats.
    Use the audio player built into the platform to playback snippets of recorded sound.

D. Sleep Pattern Tracking:

    Sleep Detection: Use sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope) or integrate with wearables (like Fitbit or Apple Watch) to detect when the user is asleep.
    Correlate snoring events with detected sleep times to track patterns.

E. User Interface:

    Dashboard: Display snoring patterns, frequency, and intensity in a clear and user-friendly dashboard.
    Statistics: Show a summary of the snoring occurrences, including the number of events, average duration, and intensity over time.
    Settings: Allow users to set parameters such as sound detection threshold, recording duration, and notification preferences.

3. Third-Party Libraries for Sound Analysis:

    AudioKit (iOS): An open-source framework for audio analysis, which can help in recording, manipulating, and analyzing sound.
    TarsosDSP (Android): A signal processing library that can be used for detecting pitch and analyzing audio signals for snoring patterns.
    TensorFlow Lite: For integrating machine learning models on mobile devices to classify sounds and detect snoring.

4. Backend (Optional):

If you plan on offering user-specific insights or analytics, you can set up a backend service:

    Firebase: Offers cloud storage and real-time database to store user data.
    AWS: Can provide backend services for handling larger data sets, including detailed snoring reports.

5. Snoring Detection Algorithm:

Here’s a simplified Python example using librosa for snoring detection. This could be adapted to mobile platforms:

import librosa
import numpy as np

# Load an audio file
y, sr = librosa.load('snoring_sample.wav')

# Perform a Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT)
D = librosa.stft(y)
freqs, times = librosa.core.time_frequency._stft_frequencies(D)

# Identify the frequency range of snoring (approx. 100-300 Hz)
snoring_freq_range = (100, 300)
mask = np.logical_and(freqs > snoring_freq_range[0], freqs < snoring_freq_range[1])

# Calculate the power within the snoring frequency range
power = np.abs(D[mask, :]) ** 2
total_power = np.sum(power)

# Compare total power with a threshold to detect snoring
threshold = 0.5
if total_power > threshold:
    print("Snoring detected!")
else:
    print("No snoring detected.")

6. Testing and Deployment:

    Test the app under different environments (noisy background, quiet rooms).
    Test with multiple snoring samples and ensure high accuracy in detecting snoring.
    Publish the app to the Google Play Store or Apple App Store.

Conclusion:

By using third-party libraries like TensorFlow Lite for AI-based sound detection and leveraging mobile app frameworks like Flutter (for cross-platform) or Android/iOS native development, you can efficiently build a snoring detection app. The app will record, analyze, and track snoring, providing insightful data to users to help improve their sleep quality.
